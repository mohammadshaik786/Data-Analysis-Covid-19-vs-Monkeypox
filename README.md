About the Project:

A Comparative Analysis of Global pandemic COVID 19 and Monkeypox and its Initiatives and the Evolution of Global Transmission examining data to discover the association. Monkeypox and Corona have a significant impact on global population. In this project, we are going to work with the COVID19 & Monkeypox dataset, published by Kaggle, which consists of the data related to the increased number of confirmed, recovered & death cases, per day, in each Country. By using Big Data tools, we are going perform data Ingestion, Processing, Analyzing and Visualizing the reports.

In this project, we will learn how to preprocess and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis. We are going to work with the COVID19 & Monkeypox dataset, published by kaggle, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed & death cases, per day, in each Country.
1. Importing required Libraries 
2. Learning Insights from reading COVID19 & Monkeypox data
3. Preparing it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.
4. Deciding on and calculating a good measure for our analysis.
5. Merging two datasets for Visualizing our analysis results.
